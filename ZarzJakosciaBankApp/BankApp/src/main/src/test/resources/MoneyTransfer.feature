Feature: MoneyTransfer tests, account is not mocked

  Scenario: Internal payment, all is ok
    Given App is fully ready to work
    Given We have user "Tomasz" with id: 1
    Given "Tomasz" have account: 2 with: 1000 pln
    Given There is an account:3 with 100 pln
    Given Everything is authorised
    When "Tomasz" make transfer from acc: 2 to acc: 3 with amount: 200
    Then account:2 value:800.0 pln
    Then account:3 value:300.0 pln

  Scenario Outline: Proper Internal money flows
    Given App is fully ready to work
    Given We have user "<user>" with id: 1
    Given "<user>" have account: <srcAcc> with: <srcAmount> pln
    Given There is an account:<dstAcc> with <dstAmount> pln
    Given Everything is authorised
    Given DAO works in a proper way
    When "<user>" make transfer from acc: <srcAcc> to acc: <dstAcc> with amount: <amount>
    Then account:<srcAcc> value:<expSrc> pln
    Then account:<dstAcc> value:<expDst> pln
    ## TODO
    Then Operation is successful
    #Then Expect updates only on proper accounts
      # |<srcAcc>|<dstAcc>|
    #Then Withdraw was logged properly
    #Then Payment was logged properly

    Examples:
      |user   |srcAcc |srcAmount  |dstAcc |dstAmount  |amount |expSrc |expDst |
      |Tomasz |1      |200        |2      |100        |158.2  |41.8   |258.2  |
      |Tomasz |1      |200        |3      |100        |200    |0      |300    |
      |Alicja |3      |1000       |1      |0          |100    |900    |100    |
